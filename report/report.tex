\section{Introduction}

This project explores methods for painting in the gradient-domain described in paper by James McCann and
Nancy S. Pollard\cite{gradient}.

In the frameworks of this project, simple GUI application that allows user to paint with gradient-painting brash will
be implemented.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Technologies}

Application is implemented in C++ programing language with the usage of the following libraries:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Qt framework}. Used for GUI and image processing.
    \item \textbf{amgcl}. Library for solving large sparse linear systems with algebraic multigrid method. It was used
    as a solver on the initial stages of development.
\end{itemize}
